# GridGain Professional Edition

The GridGain Professional Edition is a binary build of Apache Ignite™. It includes all of the [core features](https://www.gridgain.com/technology/in-memory-computing-platform) of Apache Ignite plus optional LGPL dependencies, such as Hibernate L2 cache integration and Geospatial Indexing. It benefits from ongoing QA testing by GridGain engineers and contains bug fixes which have not yet been released in the Apache Ignite™ code base. It is suitable for small-scale deployments which do not require advanced resilience or enterprise-grade security. 

The GridGain Professional Edition is available to GridGain Support customers.
